    # Empty, and deliberately so. These lists used to carry "mini"/"owl",
    # from before anyone had put a Mini on the air: the family does have a
    # speaker, Blink's own app talks to it, and it has been confirmed audible
    # here — so the default was refusing a feature that works. What belongs on
    # these lists is a family that *cannot* do it, which is a property of the
    # transport rather than the model.
    "ptt_disabled_camera_types": [],
    # "xt" and "white" are the two families Blink hands an rtsps:// URL rather
    # than immis://. Push-to-talk goes through send_session_command(), which
    # exists only on the IMMI path - BlinkRtspLiveStream raises
    # NotImplementedError for it, deliberately, because RTSP has no equivalent.
    # Left off this list the button is offered, is pressable, and can only fail.
    #
    # product_type rather than camera_type, and that is the whole point of the
    # entry: an xt reports camera_type "default", and so does a catalina, which
    # does have push-to-talk over IMMI. Gating on camera_type would take the
    # feature away from a family that has it.
    #
    # Measured 2026-09-04 on an xt: a handshake against /cameras/<slug>/ptt
    # upgraded with 101, exactly like the catalina and lotus beside it, and the
    # refusal then landed on the NotImplementedError at the end of the chain.
    # "white" is @bbolinger's measurement rather than mine; there is no white
    # on the account this was measured on.
    #
    # "superior" is on this list for a DIFFERENT reason, and the distinction
    # matters to whoever reads it next. xt and white are "never": the transport
    # has no way to carry it. superior is "not yet": it gets immis://, the path
    # exists, and it should work. It does not, because the audio shape the
    # camera expects is not the one we send.
    #
    # @bbolinger measured the cost on a Wired Floodlight: with the proxy's
    # audio config on, the camera closes the stream about four seconds into the
    # hold; without it, the close comes a few seconds after release. Either way
    # it then refuses to rejoin for about three minutes. So the button does not
    # merely fail there - it costs the live view.
    #
    # WHAT WOULD TAKE IT BACK OFF: a capture of what Blink's own app sends to a
    # superior. Match that shape and the entry is obsolete; remove it then.
    # Until anyone has one, ptt_force_enabled_slugs keeps the door open per
    # camera for whoever wants to try.

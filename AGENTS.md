## Repository Synchronization

- Before beginning any task or modifying any files, run `git fetch origin main` and compare the current branch with `origin/main`.
- If `origin/main` contains commits that are not in the current branch, rebase the current branch onto `origin/main` before making changes, then confirm the branch is zero commits behind `origin/main`.
- Never discard or overwrite existing work to perform the rebase. If the worktree is not clean, the fetch fails, or the rebase cannot be completed safely, stop and tell the user before changing files.

## Attribution

- Never add AI attribution to commits, pull requests, release notes, or other repository metadata.
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailers, `Generated-By` markers, or similar tags naming Claude, Codex, ChatGPT, OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other AI tool.
- Keep repository authorship and attribution limited to the human contributors unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

## Contributor Leaderboard

- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` carries a leaderboard of merged pull requests and commits
  per contributor. Update it once per tagged release, in the release commit
  itself — not per merged pull request. Recounting from scratch at the release
  is both less work and more accurate than incrementing a row per merge, which
  is how the counts drifted before 0.8.0.
- Recount, do not increment. Take the numbers from GitHub and `git log` rather
  than adding to the previous table, so an error corrects itself at the next
  release instead of compounding.
- The counting method is easy to get wrong, so it is written down here and
  restated in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` itself:
  - **Merged PRs** come from GitHub, not from `git log`:
    `gh pr list --state merged --limit 300 --json author --jq '.[].author.login' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`
  - **Commits** come from `git log main` and **include merge commits**. Counting
    `--no-merges` gives materially different numbers and does not reproduce any
    previously published table.
  - **Fold each person's git identities together.** Contributors here have
    committed under several name/email pairs (a GitHub noreply address, a
    personal address, a work address, and differing display names). Counting by
    raw email splits one person across several rows and understates them.
- Rank by merged pull requests, ties broken by commits.
- Say in the file which date the count was taken on and that it was taken at
  that release, so the next recount knows what it is comparing against.
- A count taken in the release commit cannot include that commit or the merge
  that lands it, so the published table always trails live numbers by a few
  commits and, for whoever cuts the release, one pull request. This is expected
  and self-corrects at the next recount. Do not chase it with follow-up commits;
  each one makes the table stale again.
- Anyone who has landed a pull request gets a row, starting at their first one.
  There is no threshold to clear.

## Conversation Maintenance

- Longer sessions are more expensive even when cached. When a task gets long, queue compaction with `scripts/conversation-maintenance.py compact --reason "context is long"` during the task.
- The same `scripts/conversation-maintenance.py` drives both Codex and Claude Code. Codex uses `.codex/hooks.json`; Claude Code uses `.claude/settings.json` (hooks merge across settings files, so these run alongside any user-level hooks).
- The project Codex `Stop` hook in `.codex/hooks.json` should run `scripts/conversation-maintenance.py drain-hook --transport auto --refresh-ui --refresh-mode window --auto-submit go --restore-focus` after the assistant turn stops. This drains queued `/compact` and `/clear` work, waits for the Codex app-server completion signal, refreshes the VS Code Codex UI, and reopens the triggering thread with `vscode://openai.chatgpt/local/<thread-id>`.
- Codex `/compact` is programmatic (app-server RPC), so it needs no composer focus. Codex `/clear` auto-submit (`--auto-submit go`) opens the thread via `vscode://openai.chatgpt/`, which activates VS Code implicitly; add `--restore-focus` so focus returns to the previously frontmost app afterward (only when VS Code was not already frontmost).
- Claude Code has no programmatic `/compact` API, so its `Stop` hook synthesizes keystrokes: `drain-hook --compact-keystroke --clear-keystroke --grab-focus --restore-focus --focus-delay 0.5 --submit-delay 1.0`. Typing `/compact` or `/clear` pops Claude Code's slash-command autocomplete, so the keystroke path waits `--submit-delay` for the menu to settle, then presses Enter twice (accept + send). `--grab-focus` activates VS Code before typing; `--restore-focus` hands focus back to the prior app after (only when VS Code was not already frontmost). A frontmost guard still gates every keystroke, so stray keys never leak.
- Use `--transport auto` by default. In the tested VS Code environment, `--transport proxy` can fail with `Cannot run compact: no live Codex app-server control socket is available`, while `--transport auto` can fall back to stdio and complete real compaction.
- Use `--refresh-mode window` by default. VS Code 1.126.0 did not expose `code --command`, so this package uses guarded Command Palette automation for `workbench.action.reloadWindow`, followed by the Codex thread restore route when a thread id is available.
- Treat `--refresh-mode webview` as opt-in only. A manual `workbench.action.webview.reloadWebviewAction` / `Developer: Reload Webviews` test froze Codex at the logo in the original environment.
- A successful real compaction is visible in the Codex UI as the inline marker `Context automatically compacted`, in addition to lower context-window usage.
- When the user switches to a clearly new task, pivots direction, or starts a new conversation branch, tell the user that the last request hit a task-pivot marker and stage a handoff with `scripts/conversation-maintenance.py clear "next task" --reason "task pivot" --summary "1-2 sentence recap of the previous conversation" --criteria "ironclad, measurable success criteria from the user's original request"`.
- The `clear` command writes a durable handoff feed at `.runtime/handoff-prompt.md` and copies it to the clipboard. The `SessionStart` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks inject that feed as `additionalContext` into the next thread and consume it once so it fires exactly once.
- Codex: creating the new thread stays a user action (click New Thread) — the handoff loads automatically. For a hands-off pivot, the Stop hook drains a queued `/clear` with `--auto-submit go` (opens a fresh chat and types `go`+Enter into the auto-focused composer), or run `clear … --open-new-thread --auto-submit go --restore-focus` immediately.
- Claude Code: the pivot is fully hands-off. Stage it with `clear "next task" --reason "task pivot" --summary "…" --criteria "…"`, then the Stop hook (`--clear-keystroke`) writes the feed at Stop time and synthesizes `/clear` itself. `/clear` fires `SessionStart source=clear`, whose hook (`handoff --emit-context --auto-submit go`) injects the feed and spawns a detached kickoff that types `go`+Enter into the reset composer, so the fresh thread self-starts its loop. `clear … --stage-feed` is the manual fallback (writes the feed now for a hand-typed `/clear`, no queue, no keystroke).
- Codex hook trust is content-hash based, and Claude Code re-prompts on `.claude/settings.json` edits. After installing this package or editing either hook file, re-approve hook trust before relying on the Stop, SessionStart, or UserPromptSubmit hooks.
- Cross-platform: all desktop automation dispatches on `sys.platform`. macOS uses `osascript`/`open`/`pbcopy`; Windows uses Windows PowerShell (Forms `SendKeys` + Win32 `SetForegroundWindow` + `clip`). No third-party keystroke tool is needed on either OS.
- Synthetic keystrokes for auto-submit and focus grab require macOS Accessibility permission for VS Code; Windows needs no equivalent grant. The clipboard copy remains a fallback if hooks or permissions are not ready.
- The reusable package is self-contained in its cloned `codex-conversation-maintenance` repo; install it into another project with `/path/to/codex-conversation-maintenance/install.sh --project /path/to/project`.
- Prerequisite: a real Codex CLI binary must be on `PATH` as `codex`, or `CODEX_BIN` must point to one. The official OpenAI installer is `curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh`. This package does not vendor that installer; it checks for the resulting CLI because the working hook path calls Codex app-server RPCs for `/compact`. The earlier remote-control daemon route was tested and abandoned, but the on-PATH CLI stayed necessary infrastructure.

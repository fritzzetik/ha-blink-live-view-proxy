"""Decide whether the proxy is too old for what this integration expects.

The two halves release together but update independently — HACS moves the
integration, and nothing moves the proxy — so an integration talking to an
older proxy is normal, not a misconfiguration. It only matters when the
integration needs a route that proxy has never had, and the failure then looks
like a 404 in a panel rather than anything about versions.

Two questions, both answered from /status alone: whether the proxy is behind,
and whether this install has any way to do something about it. The second one
decides whether the user is offered a button or a paragraph.

No Home Assistant imports: the comparison is the part worth testing.

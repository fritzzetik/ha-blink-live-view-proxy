Installed and started Blink Live View Proxy.

  Service:  blink-liveview-proxy.service - $HEALTH_NOTE
  Config:   $ETC_DIR/config.json - cameras are discovered, nothing to edit
  Token:    $TOKEN_NOTE
  Auth:     $STATE_DIR/secrets/blink-auth.json - written at first Blink login
  Updates:  $AUTOUPDATE_NOTE

Nothing else to do on this host. Finish in Home Assistant:

  1. HACS -> three-dot menu -> Custom repositories, add
     https://github.com/Teethree89/ha-blink-live-view-proxy as an Integration.
     Download "Blink Live View Proxy" and restart Home Assistant.

  2. Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration -> Blink Live View Proxy

       Proxy base URL:  http://$PROXY_HOST:$PROXY_PORT
       Proxy token:     sudo sed -n 's/^BLINK_PROXY_TOKEN=//p' $ENV_FILE

     The token is not printed here, so it stays out of logs and scrollback.

  3. Sidebar -> Blink Live View Proxy -> Authentication -> enter your Blink email and password,
     then the PIN Blink texts you while that page waits. This is the only
     interactive step there is: Blink 2FA cannot be automated, by design.

Re-run this script to upgrade, or use the one-liner, which keeps a checkout on
this host and moves it to the newest tag:

  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Teethree89/ha-blink-live-view-proxy/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash

Either way your token, config, and Blink session are kept as they are.

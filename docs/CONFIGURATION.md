# Configuration

## Proxy Config

The proxy reads JSON from:

1. `--config /path/to/config.json`
2. `BLINK_PROXY_CONFIG`
3. `config.json` next to `blink_liveview_proxy.py`

Important fields:

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8088,
  "auth_file": "/var/lib/blink-liveview-proxy/secrets/blink-auth.json",
  "ffmpeg": "ffmpeg",
  "liveview_cache_dir": "/var/lib/blink-liveview-proxy/liveviews",
  "clip_cache_dir": "/var/lib/blink-liveview-proxy/clips",
  "clip_cache_max_mb": 512,
  "mpegts_session_seconds": 60,
  "mpegts_cooldown_seconds": 30,
  "ptt_force_enabled_slugs": [],
  "ptt_disabled_camera_types": [],
  "ptt_disabled_product_types": ["xt", "white", "superior"],
  "cameras": {}
}
```

## Camera Map

The proxy can discover Blink cameras without a camera map. A map is still useful
for stable slugs and for linking proxy cameras back to official Home Assistant
Blink camera entities.

Use `name`, `id`, or `serial` to match a Blink camera:

```json
{
  "cameras": {
    "front_door": {
      "name": "Front Door",
      "entity_id": "camera.front_door"
    }
  }
}
```

`entity_id` should point to the official HA Blink camera entity. That lets the
custom integration use the normal snapshot in loading screens and snapshot
refresh actions.

## Live View Duration

The Home Assistant integration has an options flow:

```text
Settings > Devices & services > Blink Live View Proxy > Configure
```

`Live-view duration in seconds` controls how long the direct player asks the HA
route/proxy to keep each live view open. Valid range: `10-300` seconds.

Blink can still end sessions early.

## Live View Transports

Blink does not hand every camera the same kind of live-view URL, and the proxy
reads both. The transport is chosen per camera from whatever Blink returns —
there is nothing to configure, and which one a camera gets is Blink's decision
and can change under you.

- **`immis://`** — Blink's own framing, used by the newer battery cameras
  (`catalina`, `xt2`), by Mini/`owl`, and by `lotus` doorbells. This is the
  path the proxy has always taken.
- **`rtsps://`** — handed to the oldest generations, `xt` and `white`. Before
  0.5.0 these were rejected outright and had no live view at all.

The one user-visible difference is that **push-to-talk is not available on a
camera using the RTSP transport**: the transport carries no upstream audio
channel, so the proxy raises `push-to-talk is not available over RTSP` rather
than appearing to send audio nowhere. Everything else — the MSE player, HLS,
"End", snapshots, motion controls — behaves the same on both.

Blink's RTSP server does not follow RFC 2326: it answers every request with
`CSeq: 1` instead of echoing the sequence number, and omits both `Session` and
`Transport` on `SETUP`. Any one of those is fatal to a strict client, which is
why the proxy speaks the protocol itself rather than handing the URL to ffmpeg
— ffmpeg aborts with `CSeq 2 expected, 1 received` before the camera is ever
asked to wake, so the camera never lights up and nothing explains why.

## Low Latency

By default the proxy copies Blink's stream into HLS segments unchanged. Blink
sends a keyframe every four seconds and a segment can only begin on one, so
each segment holds four seconds of video and a player buffers a few of them
before it starts. The picture typically appears eight to twelve seconds after
the tap.

`hls_transcode: true` (add-on option `low_latency`) re-encodes the video with
libx264 so a keyframe can be forced every second and the segments really are
one second long. On the same cameras the picture appears in two to seven
seconds, most of which is Blink waking the camera. Audio is still copied.

The cost is one `libx264 ultrafast` encode while a live view is open, and
another for each further live view open at the same time. Measured with the
Supervisor's own add-on stats, a 720p stream takes about a tenth of one core
on a 2.7 GHz desktop i5; expect roughly half a core on a Raspberry Pi 4.

The encode is capped at 2 Mbit/s so a segment is never larger than a phone on
the far side of the house can fetch in a second, and the output frame rate is
pinned to 24 (`hls_frame_rate`), which is what every Blink camera sends. Both
matter: without the cap a busy outdoor scene reached 8 Mbit/s and stalled the
player, and without the pin a camera on a weak signal, whose stream opened with
a gap, had ffmpeg guessing a 90,000 fps frame rate and never finishing a
segment.

## ffmpeg Tuning

Four keys control how ffmpeg is invoked for HLS. The defaults are what the
measurements behind them produced, and there is normally no reason to change
any of them.

```json
{
  "ffmpeg": "ffmpeg",
  "ffmpeg_loglevel": "warning",
  "ffmpeg_probesize": 1000000,
  "ffmpeg_analyzeduration": 500000
}
```

`ffmpeg` is the binary to run. `ffmpeg_loglevel` is passed straight through to
`-loglevel`; raise it to `info` or `debug` when reading `ffmpeg.log` after a
live view failed to start.

`ffmpeg_probesize` and `ffmpeg_analyzeduration` bound how long ffmpeg inspects
the stream before writing anything — in bytes and in microseconds. ffmpeg's
MPEG-TS defaults are 5 MB and 5 seconds, whichever fills first, and Blink sends
well under a megabit, so the byte limit never filled and every live view paid
the full five seconds before its first segment existed. Bounding the window to
half a second of analysis has the first keyframe in hand about a second and a
half after `PLAY`.

The window is measured on packets whose duration ffmpeg already knows, which on
this stream means the audio. Widen both values if a camera ever sends something
the short window cannot identify.

One cosmetic effect worth knowing before you chase it in `ffmpeg.log`: on a
stream that opens with a gap, the window can end before the picture size is
known and ffmpeg logs `Could not find codec parameters ... unspecified size`.
On the default copy path that is harmless — segments are still written from the
first keyframe and play normally.

## Session Lifetime

An HLS session stays up while requests for its playlist or segments keep
arriving and is stopped `hls_idle_timeout` seconds (default `10`) after the last
one. A playing client asks for something at least once per segment, so the
timeout only fires once the player has gone. It is short on purpose: a Blink
camera streams for as long as the session exists, the official app stops the
camera the moment the viewer closes, and on a battery camera every extra idle
second is battery spent on nobody. A client that is still waiting for a slow
camera to start counts as active, so the idle timeout can be shorter than
`hls_start_timeout` (default `30`), the longest the proxy will wait for the
first segment before failing the request.

### `send_liveview_token`

Stock BlinkPy sends 64 null bytes in the auth-token field of the IMMI
handshake (see `blinkpy/livestream.py`, `get_auth_header()` — the code comment
literally says "64 null bytes for now"). `TokenAwareBlinkLiveStream` fixes
this by populating that field with the real `liveview_token` from the
liveview response.

Informal testing on a Blink Outdoor 4 (2K+, Sync Module 2, IMMI liveview)
found that individual segments consistently lasted longer with the real
token (roughly 3-8s per segment across a 100+ second run) than with the
stock zero-byte handshake (a very consistent ~2-2.5s cutoff across repeated
runs). This isn't a rigorous benchmark and Blink can still end sessions
early either way, but the pattern was consistent enough that `true` is now
the default. Set it back to `false` if you hit issues and want to compare.

## Push-to-Talk

**This is the one feature that needs an HTTPS address.** Browsers only expose
a microphone in a secure context — an HTTPS page, or `http://localhost` — so
Hold Talk cannot work from `http://<address>:8123`, which is Home Assistant's
own default and what the companion app uses at home unless you tell it
otherwise. How the proxy is reached makes no difference: the address in the
browser is what counts.

Today it fails badly rather than clearly. The button is enabled from whether
the *camera* supports push-to-talk, so on a plain-HTTP page it is offered,
looks live, and does nothing at all: the refusal is written to a status line
the player has already hidden by the time the button becomes usable, and
nothing appears in the proxy log because nothing was ever sent. If Hold Talk
seems dead, check **Blink Live View Proxy → Overview**, which has a row for
exactly this. Home Assistant Cloud (Nabu Casa) is the shortest route to an
HTTPS address; a reverse proxy with a certificate, or `ssl_certificate` and
`ssl_key` under `http:` in `configuration.yaml`, also do it.

Once the microphone is available, the player sends PCM to HA over WebSocket;
HA forwards it to the proxy; the proxy uses ffmpeg to encode AAC and sends
IMMI audio frames to Blink.

PTT is hidden for camera families in:

```json
"ptt_force_enabled_slugs": [],
"ptt_disabled_camera_types": [],
"ptt_disabled_product_types": ["xt", "white", "superior"]
```

`ptt_disabled_product_types` ships with `xt`, `white` and `superior`; the
other two lists are empty. The three are not there for the same reason, and
the difference decides when each comes back off.

**`xt` and `white` — never.** They get `rtsps://`, and `BlinkRtspLiveStream`
raises `NotImplementedError` because RTSP has no equivalent of
`send_session_command()`. There is nothing for the proxy to call, so the
button could only ever fail. No work on the proxy changes that.

**`superior` — not yet.** It gets `immis://` and the path exists, so this one
is fixable. Today the audio shape the camera expects is not the one we send,
and the cost is worse than a button that fails: with the audio config on the
camera closes the stream about four seconds into the hold, without it a few
seconds after release, and either way it refuses to rejoin for about three
minutes. A capture of what Blink's own app sends to a `superior` would make it
fixable, and the entry should come out then.

That is a different case from `mini` and `owl`, which these lists used to
carry — set before anyone had actually tried it, and a Blink Mini/`owl` was
confirmed audible on June 30, 2026. The default was hiding a control that
works, and they came off.

`ptt_disabled_camera_types` stays empty on purpose: `camera_type` cannot tell
the families apart. An `xt` reports `default`, and so does a `catalina`, which
does have push-to-talk.

Put a family on a list when it genuinely cannot do this, and use
`ptt_force_enabled_slugs` for a single camera you want back regardless.

An add-on install can set all three; they are add-on options. There, an empty
box means "keep these defaults" rather than "allow everything", so the lists
can only be added to from the add-on UI.

## Clips

The HA clip viewer lists both inventories:

```text
/api/blink_liveview_proxy/clips/viewer
```

Its Source select narrows that to the Sync Module or to Blink's cloud alone,
and the browser remembers the choice for the next open. `?source=cloud` on the
URL opens straight there.

Cloud clips exist only for an account with a Blink subscription; without one,
motion clips are written to a Sync Module's local storage and nothing else.
Listing them is metadata only. Fetching one is not, and that is why cloud
clips show a placeholder rather than a thumbnail: a thumbnail is the first
frame of the clip, so drawing a screenful would pull every clip in the window
off Blink's servers. A cloud clip is fetched when someone plays it, or when
someone presses **Load cloud thumbnails**, which says how many clips that is
before it starts. The newest six cloud clips show a thumbnail automatically;
the rest load on demand. Local clips come off your own Sync Module and are
drawn without asking.

Each clip is fetched from Blink once and kept, and its first frame is cut as
the thumbnail the viewer shows. Two keys control that:

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `clip_cache_dir` | a `clips/` directory beside `liveview_cache_dir` | Where clips and thumbnails are kept. The add-on and the Docker image use `/data/clips`; a config written before this key existed lands under the same state directory as the live-view cache |
| `clip_cache_max_mb` | `512` | Past this, the oldest files go first. A thumbnail is a few kilobytes beside its clip, so this really bounds how many clips replay instantly |

Fetching a Sync Module clip means asking the module to upload it to Blink's
cloud and waiting for it to land, several seconds each, so the proxy does one
at a time and never the same one twice. Thumbnails are only requested for the
rows on screen.

## Proxy Token

Both install paths provision this, so there is normally nothing to do:

| Install | Where the token comes from | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/install-proxy.sh` | Generated on first install, never rotated after | `/etc/blink-liveview-proxy/blink-liveview-proxy.env` |
| Add-on | Generated on first start unless `proxy_api_token` is set | `/data/proxy-token`, shared with the integration |

To set one yourself on a manual install, the service reads it from the
environment:

```bash
export BLINK_PROXY_TOKEN="long-random-token"
```

Enter the same token in the HA integration config flow — the add-on pre-fills
it. If a token is ever rejected, Home Assistant opens a reauthentication prompt
for that entry rather than failing silently.

The token is also what gates browser authentication. `/auth/*` answers `503`
while it is empty, and accepts it only as an `Authorization: Bearer` header —
never as `?token=`. Keep the token out of dashboards, shell history, and URLs;
Home Assistant adds it server-side for the authentication panel, so no browser
ever receives it.

## Install and Update Knobs

`scripts/bootstrap.sh` and `scripts/install-proxy.sh` read these from the
environment:

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `VERSION` | newest stable or prerelease tag | Install a specific tag instead |
| `FORCE` | unset | Reinstall even when that tag is already installed |
| `SRC_DIR` | `/opt/src/ha-blink-live-view-proxy` | Where the checkout lives |
| `BIND_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | `127.0.0.1` keeps the proxy on loopback |
| `PROXY_PORT` | `8088` | Listen port written into a new config |
| `BLINK_PROXY_TOKEN` | generated | Use a token of your own |
| `INSTALL_DEPS` | `1` | `0` skips the apt prerequisite install |
| `INSTALL_WATCHDOG` | `1` | `0` skips the stuck-refresh watchdog |
| `INSTALL_AUTOUPDATE` | `0` | `1` enables the nightly update timer; the on-demand updater is installed either way |

## Blink Account Authentication

Blink credentials belong to the proxy, not the integration. The integration
configures only the proxy URL, live-view duration, and this proxy token.

Three ways to authenticate, all documented step by step in
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md#re-authenticating):

| Where | How the PIN is delivered |
|---|---|
| **Blink Proxy → Authentication** tab | Typed into the page that started the login |
| Add-on without a browser | `blink_2fa_code` option, saved while it runs |
| Linux CLI | Answered at the interactive `Blink 2FA code:` prompt |

In all three the PIN is only issued *after* sign-in begins and is only valid for
the process that asked for it, so a start-time value in `--pin` or
`BLINK_2FA_CODE` (the `twofa_env` field) is deliberately ignored with a warning.
The `auth_file` holds the resulting refresh data; back it up like a secret and
keep it out of git.

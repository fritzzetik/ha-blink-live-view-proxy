# Dashboard Guide

Four ways to build a camera wall, from the sidebar to fully automatic. All
four give you the same live-view, clips, snapshot-refresh, and motion actions
per camera.

## Generate YAML in Home Assistant

Open the admin-only **Blink Live View Proxy** sidebar panel and select **YAML**. Choose a
whole dashboard, one view, or a card; optionally select one camera; then select
**Generate YAML** and **Copy YAML**. This uses the integration's current camera
inventory, so it does not ask for a proxy URL or put the proxy token in the
browser. The output needs `button-card`, like the command-line generator.

A whole dashboard or a view comes out as a **sections** view: up to three
tiles side by side on a desktop, one column on a phone. A card is a fixed
two-column grid for dropping into a layout you already control; on a phone
that gives each tile half the screen, so prefer a view where the cameras are
the point of the page.

The panel's **Cameras & entities** tab is also a live inventory: it shows each
camera's type, model, serial, network, push-to-talk availability, and related
Home Assistant entities. Select an entity to open its native More Info dialog.

## Requirements at a glance

The **Blink Live View Proxy** panel's Overview tab checks all of this against the running
install and says what to do about anything it finds — the Home Assistant
version, the official Blink integration, the proxy's blinkpy and ffmpeg, the
dialog resource below, and both frontend cards. Each row keeps its setup steps
in an accordion whether or not the check passes, so it doubles as the reference
for rebuilding this on another host.

A row can also say **Not checked**, which is not a failure: a proxy older than
0.6.1 does not report what it is running on, Lovelace may not have started when
the panel is first opened, and an integration copied in by hand rather than
installed through HACS has no update entity to read.

The dialog resource row reports whether the resource is **registered**, not
whether it is loaded on the page you are reading. Home Assistant loads Lovelace
resources on a Lovelace dashboard and nowhere else, so it is never loaded on
the panel itself — the panel loads its own copy instead.

The custom frontend cards below are dependencies, not optional enhancements.
Install them from **HACS → Frontend** before pasting the matching dashboard:

| Option | Required frontend cards | Updates when cameras change? |
|---|---|---|
| Blink Live View Proxy YAML tab | **button-card** | No — generate again |
| Hand-edited example | **button-card** | No — copy/edit a tile |
| Generated dashboard, view, or card | **button-card** | No — rerun the generator |
| Self-populating dashboard | **auto-entities** and **button-card** | Yes |

The self-populating option does not work fully without `auto-entities`: that
card discovers the camera entities and builds the card list. If you do not want
that dependency, use `scripts/generate-dashboard.py`; it discovers cameras once
and emits ordinary pasted YAML instead.

All three options also use the integration's dashboard helper resource described
below. The integration normally registers it automatically.

## The dashboard resource

The integration registers this for you when the config entry is set up:

```
/api/blink_liveview_proxy/assets/blink-liveview-dialog.js
```

Nothing below works without it, and when it is missing it fails **silently** —
the tile is there, the tap does nothing, and there is no console error, no log
line, and no failed request to point you at the cause. So if a tap does nothing
at all, check this before anything else, under
Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources.

Before 0.6.2 this was served from `/api/blink_liveview_proxy/static/...`. That
path is **still served and still works**, so nothing needs changing by hand.
It moved because Home Assistant's service worker caches any URL containing
`/static/` indefinitely over HTTPS, which pinned the file to whatever version
the browser happened to see first. Where Lovelace can be written to, the
integration rewrites the registered resource in place.

Two cases still need it added by hand, as a **JavaScript module**:

- **YAML-mode Lovelace**, where the resource list comes from
  `configuration.yaml` and cannot be written to. The log says so on startup.
- Anyone who removed it.

## Where to paste it

All three options produce a **whole dashboard**, not a single card. The
top-level `views:` key is the complete configuration for one dashboard, so
pasting the lot **replaces every view** on the dashboard you paste it into.

**Onto a new dashboard** — recommended, nothing to lose:

1. Settings → Dashboards → **+ Add dashboard** → **New dashboard from scratch**
2. Open it, click the pencil to edit, then **⋮ → Raw configuration editor**
3. Select all, delete, paste the file, **Save**

**Onto a dashboard you already have** — paste only the view, not the wrapper:

```yaml
views:
  - title: Home          # your existing view, leave it
    cards: [...]

  - title: Cameras       # <- paste from here down
    path: cameras
    cards:
      ...
```

Copy from the `- title: Cameras` line down and drop it under the `views:` key
that is already there. Do not paste the `views:` line itself, and keep the
two-space indent on `- title:` or the editor will reject it.

If **⋮** offers "Take control" instead of a raw editor, the dashboard is still
auto-generated. Take control first — that is a one-way change.

## Restart Home Assistant button

[`examples/homeassistant-restart-button.yaml`](../examples/homeassistant-restart-button.yaml)
is a standalone native button card. It needs no custom card or package:

1. Open the dashboard and select **Edit dashboard**.
2. Select **Add card**, choose **Manual**, and paste the example.
3. Save the card.

The button asks for confirmation and then calls `homeassistant.restart`, the
same Home Assistant Core action used by the UI and API. Home Assistant checks
the configuration before restarting and cancels the restart if the check
fails. Only administrators can run it.

This restarts Home Assistant itself. It is separate from restarting the Blink
proxy service or add-on described in the package example.

## What each camera can do

| Action | Fired as | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| Live view | `blink_liveview_proxy` | `slug` |
| Local clips | `blink_liveview_proxy_clips` | `slug` |
| Fresh snapshot | `blink_snapshot_refresh` | `slug` |
| Motion on/off | `switch.toggle` | official Blink integration |

`entity_id` and `source_entity_id` are optional everywhere — they default to
`camera.blink_live_<slug>` and `camera.<slug>`. Pass them when your entities
were renamed.

Push-to-talk, **End** and **Save MP4** are inside the live-view dialog,
not on the tile. PTT only appears for cameras the proxy reports as supporting
it; `xt`, `white` and `superior` are refused by default and any single camera
can be opted back in with `ptt_force_enabled_slugs`. Mini/`owl` cameras are
offered it — they used to be denied by default, before one was confirmed
audible.

Being offered it is not the same as being able to use it: the browser only
hands over a microphone on an HTTPS page, so Hold Talk cannot work from
`http://<address>:8123` no matter which camera it is. Overview has a row for
this.

## Option 1 — Copy one camera and edit

[`examples/lovelace-dashboard.yaml`](../examples/lovelace-dashboard.yaml)

One fully commented camera with all four actions. Copy the block per camera and
change the slug. Needs **button-card** only.

Best if you want to restyle things, or only have a couple of cameras.

## Option 2 — Generate it from the proxy

[`scripts/generate-dashboard.py`](../scripts/generate-dashboard.py)

Asks the running proxy what exists and prints finished YAML. `--format`
decides what shape, so you are not forced to replace a dashboard just to get
the cameras in:

```bash
# a whole dashboard (default)
python3 scripts/generate-dashboard.py > cameras.yaml

# one view, to add to a dashboard you already have
python3 scripts/generate-dashboard.py --format view

# a single card for the manual-card editor, nothing else touched
python3 scripts/generate-dashboard.py --format card

# just one camera, as a bare card
python3 scripts/generate-dashboard.py --format card --camera front_door
```

| `--format` | Produces | Paste into |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboard` | `views:` — a complete dashboard | Raw configuration editor, replacing everything |
| `view` | one `- title: Cameras` sections view | Raw configuration editor, under the existing `views:` |
| `card` | one `vertical-stack` card | + Add card → Manual |
| `card --camera SLUG` | one `picture-elements` tile | + Add card → Manual |

By default the output carries only the **Proxy** pill, because that is the one
that works with the integration alone. Add `--with-package` for the Cameras,
Health and Reload pills once you have installed
[`examples/homeassistant-package.yaml`](../examples/homeassistant-package.yaml)
— without it those two read a sensor that does not exist and Reload calls a
script that does not exist, so it looks fine and silently does nothing.

Other options: `--proxy-url http://homeassistant.local:8088` and
`--token "$BLINK_PROXY_TOKEN"` if the proxy requires one.

`--demo` builds from a made-up four-camera inventory and contacts nothing, so
you can see the output shapes without a proxy running. The checked-in
`examples/generated-*.yaml` files are produced that way, which is why they show
`front_door` and `kitchen` rather than anyone's real cameras.

Every shape carries its own paste instructions in the printed header. Needs
**button-card** only, and nothing renders at view time.

Re-run it after adding a camera — the output is a snapshot, not a live view.

Find your slugs the same way it does:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/cameras
```

## Option 3 — Populate itself

[`examples/lovelace-auto-populate.yaml`](../examples/lovelace-auto-populate.yaml)

Builds a tile for every `camera.blink_live_*` entity as it appears. Add a camera
in Blink, restart the proxy, and it shows up with no YAML edits.

Needs **auto-entities** and **button-card**.

It works because the integration puts everything a card needs onto the camera
entity as attributes, so the template reads them back instead of you typing
them:

| Attribute | Use |
|---|---|
| `proxy_slug` | the slug in every proxy URL |
| `blink_entity_id` | official Blink camera, for the thumbnail |
| `ptt_supported` | whether PTT is offered |
| `camera_type` | `default`, `doorbell`, `mini` |
| `product_type` | `catalina`, `lotus`, `owl`, `xt` … |

To show only some cameras, filter on those attributes — for example only the
ones that can talk back:

```jinja
{%- for s in states.camera
      if s.entity_id.startswith('camera.blink_live_')
      and state_attr(s.entity_id, 'ptt_supported') -%}
```

## Motion detection entity names

The motion switch belongs to the **official** Blink integration, and its name
comes from the camera's name there, not from the proxy slug. Options 2 and 3
guess `switch.<slug>_camera_motion_detection`. When a camera was renamed on one
side only, that guess is wrong and the button shows as unavailable — fix the
entity id or delete that element.

## Status pills and the reload button

The dashboards open with a pill row: proxy up/down, `N of M` cameras
discovered, an overall health pill, and a reload button.

**Only the Proxy pill works on its own.** The other three need
[`examples/homeassistant-package.yaml`](../examples/homeassistant-package.yaml):
Cameras and Health read its REST sensor, and Reload calls its guarded script.
Without that package the first two render as a stub and Reload looks perfectly
normal while doing nothing at all.

So either install the package, or delete those three pills. The generator
leaves them out unless you pass `--with-package`.

The reload button calls `script.blink_reload_guarded`, which **refuses to run**
unless a reload could actually help. Hold it to force. That is not
over-engineering — a reload re-runs the full Blink login, and an unguarded
reload loop will text you until the account is rate-limited. The reasoning and
the incident behind it are in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md).

## Wall panels

On low-power Android panels, tap-to-toggle talk is more reliable than
press-and-hold: the WebView is decoding video and capturing microphone audio at
the same time. Browser microphone capture also needs a trusted HTTPS origin —
see [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

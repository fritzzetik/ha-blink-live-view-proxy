"""Checks on the dashboard's prerequisite readout.

No Home Assistant, no network. The module is imported directly, which is why
it carries no Home Assistant imports of its own. Run from the repo root:

    python tests/test_prerequisites.py

The rule being defended everywhere below is that "cannot be checked" is not
"broken". A proxy too old to report its environment, and a Lovelace that has
not started, are both ordinary states of a working install, and a readout that
painted them red would send people to repair something that was already right.
